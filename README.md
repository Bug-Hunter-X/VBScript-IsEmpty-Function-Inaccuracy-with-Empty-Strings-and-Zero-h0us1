This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript's `IsEmpty` function.  The `IsEmpty` function is designed to check if a variable is uninitialized or contains a null value. However, it behaves unexpectedly with empty strings ("") and the numeric value 0. This can lead to errors in functions where optional parameters are involved. The `bug.vbs` file shows the problem, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a more robust solution.
